        Iv'e always been passionate about web development, even before knowing
        what it was. funny, right? but as a little girl playing my favorite
        virtual pets game, I somehow dug into the source code and realized I can
        modify it to my liking, making it appear as I own some rare pets by
        changing the images source. aware of the changes not actually being
        saved, I was wondering if I can 'host' the outcome somewhere else where
        it can be viewd publicly.

        As a full stack developer in the present, I just love seeing my code
        come to life as functional applications or beautiful websites. I always
        seek to use the most up-to-date technologies, while keeping my code
        clean and reusable as possible. In my current role, I have developed
        complex applications using Nuxt (Vue.js), Node.js, MongoDB and
        microservice architecture.
      </p>

        Aside from my technical skills, I'm a team player who can work well in
        cooperation with fellow developers and other teams, as well as
        independently. I'm also a fast, self-sufficient learner who can pick up
        new technologies quickly.
